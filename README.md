how can we use predictive modelling and computational biology to predict any future outbreak of NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases)? we propose a sentinel surveillance tracking system using pre-existing HIV patient care infrastructure.

our three-tier solution: 

1) first, quantifies a median time lead using HIV-patients (whom display symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis earlier than normal asymptomatic carriers)
2) then, predicts geographical hotspots of future spread depending on weather conditions, soil moisture, humidity, and most importantly -- known diagnoses of VL 
3) allows scientists to THEN geographically locate areas for wastewater RNA sequencing. which allows public health officials to accurately identify the spread of distinct VL strands.

attached in the repo our demo for the geographical risk map. 

below is a basic diagramme of step one -- the temporal advantage gained:

How can we use predictive modelling and computational biology to predict future outbreaks of NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases) in under-resourced communities?

we propose a sentinel surveillance tracking system using pre-existing HIV patient care infrastructure.

our three-tier solution which... 

1) first, quantifies a median time lead using HIV-patients (whom display symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis earlier than normal asymptomatic carriers)

2) then, predicts geographical hotspots of future spread depending on weather conditions, soil moisture, humidity, and most importantly -- known diagnoses of VL using HIV-sentinel cases. (demo attached in repo)

3) before allowing local scientists to then geographically locate areas for wastewater RNA sequencing. which allows public health officials to accurately identify the spread of distinct VL strands.
